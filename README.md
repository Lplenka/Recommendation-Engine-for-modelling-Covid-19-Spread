# Modelling-COVID-19-Spread
A Data Analytics project: Geometric modelling of COVID-19 epidemic spread in a supermarket.

Main Code TODOs:
- Create a store graph/network
- Create paths for users (possible paths and chosen paths)
- Create model for virus transmission (distance, R value, etc.)
- Create simulation implementation
